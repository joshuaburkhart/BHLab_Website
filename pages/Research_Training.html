<h2>Research Training</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our lab typically includes researchers from the post-doctoral to the undergraduate level.  We choose to work with a small number of doctoral students at any one time, never more than two, because we believe in a highly interactive one-on-one mentorship style.  The most fundamental maxim of our lab is to &ldquo;move the body knowledge forward.&rdquo;  Towards that end, we do not cease to ask each other &ldquo;What is new and different about this idea or experiment?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Why should anyone care about these results?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this work likely to have broad implications in related fields?&rdquo; Or, sometimes more simply, &ldquo;Would this experiment with mosquitoes be of interest to a plant biologist?&rdquo; <br />
  </p>
  <p> Graduate students and post-docs are expected to develop their own research interests, to participate in funded research, and to learn mentorship through working with undergraduates engaged in projects that are independent of our funded research but in line with the major research themes of the lab.  Over half of the undergraduate honors theses result in publication with the undergraduate as a co-author on the paper.  There is obviously some stratification in the lab, but all participants have input to all ongoing and proposed research. </p>
  <p>Research in our lab is currently funded by three separate National Science Foundation grants, including an &ldquo;EAGER&rdquo; grant, which is awarded specifically to support transformative high-risk, high-gain research.</p>

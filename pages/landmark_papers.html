<h2>Selected Landmark Papers from Our Lab</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1972, 1974, 1980</strong>.  First action spectra varying both wavelength and intensity for dawn and dusk transitions in photoperiodic response, thereby providing the first estimates in any animal for the astronomic limits that constitute a &ldquo;day.&rdquo;<em> Science</em> 175:1361-1362; <em>Biol. Bull.</em> 146:11-19; <em>Oecologia</em> 44:311-316. [<a href="../articles/WEB72sci.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/WEB74.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/B&P80.pdf">pdf</a>] </p>
  <p><strong>1976</strong>.  First determination of the relationship between altitude and latitude in photoperiodic response, establishing that photoperiodic response tracks the seasonal gradient of North America more closely than any other known ecogeographic trait.  This conclusion persists to this day. <em>Nature</em> 262:384-386. [<a href="../articles/WEB76nat.pdf">pdf</a>] </p>
  <p><strong>1983, 1988</strong>.  Non-equilibrium communities of tree-hole mosquitoes in nature are maintained by habitat segregation, drought and predation; the determinants of habitat segregation among the constituent species are genus-level traits and are therefore not a consequence of competitively driven, co-evolved niche shifts as previously predicted by ecological theory. <em>Oecologia</em> 57: 239-256. [<a href="../articles/B&H83oec.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/B&H88.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>1989</strong>. Density-dependent development over a wide geographic range in nature is not correlated with either capacity for increase or carrying capacity.  r- and K-selection theory is totally without universal predictive power in natural populations. <em>Am. Nat</em>.133:869-887. [<a href="../articles/B&H89an.pdf">pdf</a>] </p>
  <p> <strong>1993, 1997, 2005</strong>.  Evolution between and within natural populations of <em>Wyeomyia smithii </em>involves complex gene-gene interaction (epistasis). Geographically close sub-populations within a single bog show distinct genetic fingerprints, indicating that population subdivision occurs over a very fine scale or that unique genetic trajectories underlie the evolution of similar phenotypes.  Subdivided populations are capable of rapid response to selection and may account for evolution over contemporary time scales.  <em>Am. Nat.</em> 142:457-473; <em>Evolution</em> 51:451-458; <em>Genetics</em> 147:1873-1883; 169:485-488. [<a href="../articles/HBH93an.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/ABH97evo.pdf">pdf</a>] <a href="../articles/LBH97.pdf">[pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/BHH05.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>1995, 1997, 2002</strong>. The optimal degree of protandry that maximizes fitness depends not only on the time of emergence of males relative to females, but also on female fecundity and the emergence times of other males in the population.  Protandry can be a consequence of natural as well as sexual selection. <em>Ecology</em> 76:1242-1250; 78:969-976; 83:607-611. [<a href="../articles/KHBHF95.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/BHKH97.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/H&B02.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>2001, 2006, 2008</strong>.  The first demonstration of a genetic response driven by recent rapid climate change.  This genetic shift was shown to occur over as short a time span as five years in photoperiodic response of <em>Wyeomyia smithii</em>. Subsequent studies showed a genetic component in response to climate change in the timing of seasonal events of insects, birds, mammals and plants, but in no case has there been shown to be a genetic shift in thermal optimum or heat tolerance associated with recent rapid climate change in populations in nature.   <em>PNAS</em> 98:14509-14511, <em>Science</em> 312:1477-1478; <em>Mol. Ecol</em>. 17:157-166. [<a href="../articles/B&H01pnas.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/B&H06sci.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/B&H08Mecol.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>2003, 2006, 2009, 2010.</strong>  Evolution of the seasonal photoperiodic timer has evolved independently of the daily circadian clock over the climatic gradient of North America in <em>Wyeomyia smithii</em>.  It is therefore difficult to argue that circadian rhythmicity constitutes the necessary, causal mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement. <em>Am. Nat.</em> 161:735-748; 167:601-605; <em>J. Comp. Physiol. A.</em> 195:385-391; <em>J. Biol. Rhythms</em> 25:155-165. [<a href="../articles/BQH03an.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/BHM06.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/EDBH09.pdf">pdf</a>] [<a href="../articles/B&H10jbr.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>2004.</strong>  During evolutionary dispersal of <em>Wyeomyia smithii</em> throughout the climatic gradient of North America, photoperiodic adaptation has been a more important determinant of fitness than thermal adaptation.  In fact, when northern populations are subjected to 180 years of climate warming at its present rate, year-long fitness is improved.  However, when they experience parallel, incorrect photic cues (day lengths), they lose 80% fitness.  Hence, selection should be expected to favor more rapid evolution of photoperiodic response than thermal tolerance during periods of rapid climate change.  <em>Evolution</em> 58:1748-1762. [<a href="../articles/BZH04.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>2007.</strong>  The first QTL map of photoperiodic response in any animal revealed a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; spot in the <em>Wyeomyia smithii</em> genome that includes genes responsible for interpreting day length, for the determination of diapause, and for the hormonal regulation of development and molting. <em>Genetics</em> 176:391-402. [<a href="../articles/MJBH07.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>2009.</strong>  Regulatory, physiological and developmental processes can be tightly integrated into units (modules) made up of multiple genes.  Using the core genes comprising the daily circadian clock of Drosophila and other Diptera, we show that simply because a single gene constitutes an important component of a module does not preclude its having a separate and important ancillary function outside of its modular unit.  This underappreciated but essential distinction between modular and gene pleiotropy has revolutionized the field of biological time-keeping mechanisms.  <em>Trends Genetics</em> 25:217-225. [<a href="../articles/EBH09tig.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>2010.</strong>  The first fine-scale phylogeography using second-generation high throughput sequencing in any animal to generate over 3,000 phylogenetically informative loci and to determine the direction of evolution during post-glacial dispersal following recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  <em>PNAS</em> 107:16196-16200. [<a href="../articles/EMCHCBH10.pdf">pdf</a>]</p>
